# Projects
Here is a brief description on the projects that I've created by myself or worked on together with others

## Forex-Converter
This project serves as a basic forex converter using the Forex-python API at https://forex-python.readthedocs.io/en. The design is very simple because I focused more on the functionality overall

## Jeopardy
This project is a basic jeopardy game without calulation of points by categories. I've used the jService API (https://jservice.io/) to pull in questions separated by different categories. The categories as well as the questions are generated randomly per refresh of page

## Hack-or-Snooze
For this project, I implemented the front end functionalities of favoriting stories, adding and deleting stories from page as well as being able to display user stories

## Multi-algorithm-runner 
Worked as a collaborator for multi-algoirthm-runner (https://multi-algorithm-runner.web.app). I was actively involved in creating unit and integration tests for our calculators as well as testing the UI on the website itself
